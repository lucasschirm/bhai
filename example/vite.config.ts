/**
 * Vite config for the bhai WebLLM example.
 *
 * This example consumes the workspace-linked `@lucasschirm/bhai` package's BUILT
 * `dist/` output (imported by its published subpath names, e.g.
 * `@lucasschirm/bhai`, `@lucasschirm/bhai/plugins/webllm` — never `../../src/*.ts`).
 * That's why the root `pnpm run preview` script runs `pnpm run build` first.
 *
 * @mlc-ai/web-llm's internal worker/wasm handling can cause dev-server
 * pre-bundling issues, so we exclude it from Vite's default esbuild
 * pre-bundling. MLC's engine does its own dynamic wasm/worker loading that
 * Vite's default esbuild pre-bundling can mishandle.
 *
 * Note: Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
 * (COEP) headers are sometimes required for SharedArrayBuffer-based
 * WebGPU/WASM setups, but they are INTENTIONALLY LEFT OFF here by default
 * (would require `server.headers` config). The standard @mlc-ai/web-llm
 * WebGPU path does not require them for basic operation — this is a
 * tradeoff between simplicity and advanced features like SAB-based
 * threading. If you need SAB support, add:
 *
 *   server: {
 *     headers: {
 *       "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
 *       "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
 *     },
 *   },
