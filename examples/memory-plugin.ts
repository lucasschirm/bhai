/** @file Agent-memory plugin reference example (TASK_0037, ARCHITECTURE.md § 11.7)
 *
 * Reproduces the agent-memory pattern exactly: a factory function accepting a
 * MemoryStore, returning a capability-object form with `save_memory` tool,
 * `start`-time recall injection, and `compact(before)` fact extraction.
 *
 * The factory-function design (accepting memoryStore as a parameter) matches
 * the capability object's own literal authoring style in § 11.7, where the
 * `memoryStore` is both the plugin's closed-over dependency and a recognized
 * capability-object key. This avoids requiring a separate host-level wiring
 * step — the host provides storage, the factory closes over it, and the
 * kernel's `memoryStore` capability-object key is wired automatically.
