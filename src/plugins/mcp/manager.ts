// MCP server lifecycle manager — observable connect/retry/refresh/detach state
// on top of `bh.addMcp()` (ARCHITECTURE.md § 6 line 215, § 9.3).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: `McpRegistry` (src/core/mcp-integration.ts) stores handles
// and fires `mcp.attached`, but it deliberately keeps no lifecycle state — it
// has no notion of "connecting", it does not retain WHY a connect failed, and
// it has no detach path. A host that renders MCP servers in a UI needs all
// three: a status to show while the handshake is in flight, the structured
// failure reason to show when it fails, and a way to take a server back out.
// This class is that layer, and it lives in the plugin (not the kernel)
// because the kernel must stay free of anything optional (§ 5, packaging rule
// 1).
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): web-standard APIs only — `crypto.randomUUID`,
// `Date.now`. No Node built-ins.

import type { McpHandle } from "../../core/mcp-integration.js"
