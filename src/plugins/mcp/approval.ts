// MCP human-in-the-loop approval gate + untrusted-by-default flag
// (ARCHITECTURE.md § 9.3 items 6-7, § 13 Security considerations).
//
// Scope of THIS file (TASK_0013):
//  - Define the `ApprovalGate` injectable function type — the temporary
//    integration seam that wraps every MCP `tools/call` (and, via
//    TASK_0014, every `sampling/createMessage`) in a human-in-the-loop
//    approval step.
//  - Implement the refusal policy: refuse unless either a gate subscriber
//    exists OR the host explicitly opted out via `autoApproveTools: true`.
//  - Provide the `McpApprovalOptions` shape consumed by `McpClient`'s
//    constructor (and threaded through `bh.addMcp()` by TASK_0015).
//
// TEMPORARY INTEGRATION SEAM — READ THIS BEFORE WIRING FURTHER:
// The `ApprovalGate` function type below is a PLACEHOLDER for the real
// `tool(beforeCall)` blockable framework/conversation event that
// TASK_0026 will build as part of the full agent-loop tool-invocation
// sequence. Until TASK_0026 lands, this gate is a bare injected function
// supplied at `McpClient` construction / `bh.addMcp()` time. When
// TASK_0026 lands, it MUST replace/wire this `approvalGate` parameter so
// that it actually dispatches through the framework's event bus
// (patch-chaining, block semantics, etc. from TASK_0004) rather than
// being a bare injected function. TASK_0013's own responsibility is
// limited to defining the seam's shape and implementing the refusal
// policy around it — NOT building the real event. This is documented
// prominently here and in TASK_0013's notes so a future reader does not
// mistake the bare function for the final mechanism.
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): web-standard APIs only. This file touches
// nothing outside of plain TypeScript — no `fetch`, no `crypto`, no Node
// built-ins. It is runtime-agnostic and side-effect-free apart from the
// injected gate callback.
