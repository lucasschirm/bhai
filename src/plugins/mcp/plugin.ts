// The MCP plugin — the capability object that fills the kernel's MCP seam
// (ARCHITECTURE.md § 7.2, § 9.3).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: `src/core/` must never import `src/plugins/` (packaging
// rule 1), so `bh.addMcp()` cannot construct an `McpClient` on its own. The
// kernel instead exposes `bh.registerMcpClientFactory()` and refuses to attach
// anything until something fills it — its error message literally reads
// "Call `bh.use(mcpPlugin)`". This module is that `mcpPlugin`: the host-side
// half of the inversion, plus the {@link McpManager} that makes attached
// servers observable.
//
// LIFECYCLE ORDERING: form-2 capability objects have no `setup` hook (the
// allowlist has no such key), so registration happens in `initialize`, which
// `bh.init()` runs in step 2 — after every plugin's `initialize`, but BEFORE
// it resolves `getMcps` hooks. The factory is therefore in place for both
// declaratively-attached servers (this plugin's own `getMcps`) and imperative
// `bh.addMcp()` calls made after `init()` resolves. The one thing a host
// cannot do is `addMcp()` before `init()` — that throws, as it did before this
// plugin existed.
