# `src/tools/` — tool registry

## Purpose & scope
The in-process tool registry — the single source of truth for every callable tool BHAI knows about (ARCHITECTURE.md § 9.2). Modeled as "one in-process MCP server": every registration path (imperative `addTool`, `@Tool` decorator, capability-object `tools:`, remote MCP attachment) converges on the store here, so `bh.listTools()` is semantically `tools/list` and invocation is semantically `tools/call`, regardless of where a tool came from.

## Key files
- `registry.ts` — `ToolRegistry` class + standalone `normalizeToolResult()` helper (TASK_0008). Stores `BHAIToolDefinition` records keyed by `name` in a `Map`, validates names against § 9.1's regex, implements shadowing (replace, no `tool.removed` fired), and fires `tool.registered`/`tool.removed` (§ 8.1) via the framework `EventBus`'s kernel bypass. Also satisfies the `ToolRegistrar` seam so `@Tool`-decorated methods register through it.
- `registry.test.ts` — 26 tests covering object/sugar forms, shadowing, name validation, `normalizeToolResult`'s three branches, snapshot freshness, minimal filter subset, the `ToolRegistrar` seam, and accessors.

## Conventions
- **No `execute()` invocation here**: the registry only stores tools. Calling `execute()`, validating arguments against `inputSchema`, `outputSchema` validation, the `tool(beforeCall)`/`tool(processing)` event sequence, and serial/concurrent batching all belong to TASK_0026 (the agent loop's tool-invocation pipeline). This boundary is documented in `registry.ts`'s "Explicit non-scope" comment.
- **Filtering is minimal**: `listTools(filter?)` implements only identity + name allow/deny + tag include/exclude for § 6 signature compatibility. The full § 9.5 3-step resolution order (driver-capability gating, conversation overrides) is TASK_0017's `resolveAvailableTools`.
- **Shadowing ≠ removal**: re-registering a tool with an existing name replaces the definition and fires only `tool.registered` (not `tool.removed`). `tool.removed` is reserved for explicit `removeTool()` calls. Documented as an explicit assumption in `registerInternal`.
- **Origin-agnostic storage**: the registry has no knowledge of "where a tool came from" (local plugin vs. MCP). That distinction lives in the `mcp__<server>__<tool>` name prefix (TASK_0011) and is invisible here.

## Consumers
- `src/core/bhai.ts` instantiates a `ToolRegistry` and delegates `addTool`/`removeTool`/`listTools` to it. The `toolRegistrar` seam (used by `decorators.ts`) also funnels through `ToolRegistry.register`.
- Future: TASK_0011 (MCP discovery) registers remote tools into this registry; TASK_0017 (`resolveAvailableTools`) reads from it; TASK_0026 (agent loop) invokes `execute()` on records from here.
