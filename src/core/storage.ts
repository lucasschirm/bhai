 * elsewhere in the codebase (tools, drivers). This explicit policy is documented
 * here since § 11.4 does not address multiple stores.

/**
 * Wire up auto-save subscription on the BHAI framework bus.
 *
 * When a `ConversationStore` is registered (not undefined), this function
 * subscribes to the framework-level `bh.on('conversation.message', handler)`
 * event (which, via TASK_0023's mirroring, observes every conversation created
 * or loaded by this kernel instance). The handler:
 *
 * 1. Checks if `state === 'sent'`.
 * 2. If true, calls `store.save(conversation.toJSON())`.
 * 3. If false or any other state, returns (no-op).
 *
 * This is a single subscription per kernel instance, not per conversation, so it
 * observes all conversations automatically via the mirroring mechanism.
 *
 * If NO `ConversationStore` is registered, this function is a no-op and no
 * subscription is created.
 *
 * ASYNC ORDERING: auto-save does not await the `store.save()` promise — it
 * fires and forgets. If save fails, the error is not propagated to the kernel
 * or the conversation; logs or error tracking are the host's concern.
 *
 * @param bh The BHAI kernel instance.
 * @param store The active `ConversationStore` capability (if any).

 *
 * The error-on-missing-store policy is intentional and documented: a host calling
