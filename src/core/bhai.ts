// BHAI kernel class — the framework entry point (ARCHITECTURE.md § 6).
//
// Scope of THIS file: the constructor and `use()` (TASK_0003, plugin forms 1
// & 2; form 3 added by TASK_0007), `on()`/`emit()` (TASK_0004), `init()`/
// `dispose()` lifecycle (TASK_0005), and the plugin-configuration contract
// (TASK_0006, § 7.4 — `declareConfig`/`setConfig`/`getConfig` plus the
// validation-and-defaulting step inside `init()`). Every other § 6 method is
// stubbed with a `// TODO(TASK_XXXX)` comment naming the owning task; calling
// a stub throws so accidental use surfaces immediately rather than silently
// no-op'ing.
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): this file uses only web-standard APIs.
// `crypto.randomUUID()` is the only external surface touched, and it is
// available in every supported runtime (browsers, Node ≥ 19, Deno, Bun).
// `ajv` (the JSON Schema validator used by TASK_0006's config step) is a
// pure-JS dependency with no environment-specific bindings, so importing it
// here does not violate the "web-standard APIs only" rule — it runs
// identically in every supported runtime.
//
// PATH NOTE: TASK_0003 specifies `bhai/src/kernel/bhai.ts`, but the package
// layout already established by TASK_0002 places the kernel under
// `src/core/` (see `src/core/index.ts` and the `./core` subpath export in
// `package.json`). This file follows the existing repo convention to keep
// one kernel directory; the behavioral contract is unchanged.

// `ajv` is chosen as the JSON Schema validator for TASK_0006's config step
// (§ 7.4) over alternatives (zod-to-JSON-Schema bridges, a hand-rolled
// minimal validator) because:
//  - it directly validates JSON Schema, the dialect BHAI already standardizes
//    on for tool `inputSchema`/`outputSchema` (§ 9.1, 2020-12 dialect);
//  - it is widely used and battle-tested in the JS/TS ecosystem;
//  - it needs no schema-authoring-library lock-in (unlike zod, which would
//    require plugin authors to learn a second schema DSL just for config).
// This is a RETROACTIVE runtime dependency addition: TASK_0001's scaffolding
// anticipated only dev tooling. `ajv` is therefore declared in
// `package.json` under `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`) by TASK_0006,
// and is noted as such in the task's commit/PR description rather than
// silently introduced as if it had always been there.
