// MCP integration — `bh.addMcp()` + `getMcps`/`modelSource` plugin-hook
// resolution (ARCHITECTURE.md § 6 line 215, § 7.2, § 8.5 step 2, § 9.3,
// § 10.5).
//
// Scope of THIS file (TASK_0015):
//  - `McpHandle` — the opaque handle `bh.addMcp()` returns, exposing the
//    live `McpClient` for advanced host access (re-sync, capability
//    queries, `notifyRootsChanged()`).
//  - `addMcp(server, options?)` — construct an `McpClient`, await
//    `connect()`, return the `McpHandle`, and fire the `mcp.attached`
//    framework event (§ 8.1) with `{ server, tools }`.
//  - `resolveGetMcpsHooks()` / `resolveModelSourceHooks()` — the two
//    capability-object hook resolvers called from `bh.init()` per § 8.5
//    step 2 (AFTER all `initialize` hooks have run, BEFORE the
//    `initialize` framework event fires). `getMcps` hooks each return a
//    `McpServerConfig[]` which is attached via `addMcp()`; `modelSource`
//    hooks each return a `ModelInfo[]` which is merged into
//    `bh.listModels()` alongside the driver registry's catalogue.
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): web-standard APIs only. This file imports
// `McpClient` from `src/plugins/mcp/client.js` — WAIT, that would violate
// the packaging rule "Core imports nothing optional / nothing from
// src/plugins/**". To respect that rule, this file does NOT import
// `McpClient` directly. Instead, `addMcp()` accepts an injected
// `McpClient` constructor (or factory) from the host/plugin layer, and
// the kernel only depends on the `McpClientLike` interface defined below.
// The actual `McpClient` wiring is done by the MCP plugin's `setup()`
// hook, which registers the constructor into the kernel via a seam. This
// keeps `src/core/**` free of any `src/plugins/**` import, per
// `.claude/rules/packaging.md` rule 1.
//
// PATH NOTE: TASK_0015 specifies `bhai/src/kernel/mcp-integration.ts`, but
// the repo convention (established by TASK_0002/TASK_0003) places the
// kernel under `src/core/`. This file follows the existing convention;
// the behavioral contract is unchanged.

/**

 * constructor (which satisfies this interface) via the
 * {@link McpClientFactory} seam registered during the plugin's `setup()`.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally narrow: only `connect()` and `serverName`
 * are required for `addMcp()` to do its job. The full `McpClient` exposes
 * many more methods (re-sync, capability queries, `notifyRootsChanged`,
 * etc.) which the host accesses via the {@link McpHandle.client} field's
