// Framework event bus — the single dispatch mechanism underpinning every
// observable behavior in BHAI (§ 8). One instance lives on each `BHAI` kernel
// (the framework bus); TASK_0023 will instantiate one per `Conversation` too,
// reusing this exact class unchanged.
//
// Scope of THIS file (TASK_0004): the standalone, reusable `EventBus` class
// implementing § 8.2's five handler-semantics rules and § 8.4's emission
// asymmetry — sequential awaited dispatch with patch chaining, blockable
// pipelines, error containment + rerouting, reserved-namespace enforcement on
// the public `emit()` with an internal `dispatch()` bypass for kernel-originated
// events, and global per-bus FIFO serialization of re-entrant emissions.
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): web-standard APIs only. This file touches nothing
// outside of plain TypeScript — no `fetch`, no `crypto`, no timers. It is
// runtime-agnostic and safe to instantiate in any environment.
//
// PATH NOTE: TASK_0004 specifies `bhai/src/kernel/event-bus.ts`, but the
// package layout already established by TASK_0002/TASK_0003 places the kernel
// under `src/core/` (see `src/core/index.ts` and the `./core` subpath export in
// `package.json`). This file follows the existing repo convention; the
// behavioral contract is unchanged.
