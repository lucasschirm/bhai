// TASK_0021 — Credential resolution chain tests (§ 10.4).
//
// These tests cover `resolveCredentials`' three-tier priority chain using
// mocked `CredentialResolver` hooks. They do NOT test the plugin registry
// (TASK_0005), the driver/MCP call sites (TASK_0019/TASK_0020/TASK_0011),
// or any OAuth/token-refresh logic (explicitly out of scope per § 10.4).
//
// The `authHooks` parameter is supplied directly to `resolveCredentials` as
// a plain array — this is the locally-injected list variant (the BHAI kernel
// would pass `getRegisteredPlugins().filter(p => p.auth).map(p => p.auth)` in
// production, but this test file does not depend on the kernel's plugin
// registry accessor).
