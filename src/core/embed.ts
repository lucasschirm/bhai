/**
 * Embedding side channel — RAG substrate (ARCHITECTURE.md § 6, § 10.1, § 11.8).
 *
 * Resolves a model, checks that the driver declares `embeddings: true` capability,
 * and delegates to `driver.embed()` to produce vectors. Fires zero conversation-bus
 * events; intended as a portable, driver-agnostic indexing substrate for RAG plugins
 * (chunking, embedding, upserting into a vector store).
 *
 * Behavior:
 * 1. **Abort guard**: if `req.signal?.aborted` is already true, reject immediately
 *    without touching model resolution or the driver registry.
 * 2. **Model resolution**: apply the same four-tier resolution order (§ 10.5) used
 *    by conversations and `complete()`, reusing the shared {@link resolveConversationModel}
 *    function verbatim — never reimplement.
 * 3. **Capability guard (the core of this task)**: call `driver.capabilities(modelId)`.
 *    If the result's `embeddings` field is not exactly `true`, throw a clear,
 *    descriptive error identifying both the resolved model ref and the driver id.
 *    **This guard must fire BEFORE any attempt to call `driver.embed()`.** Do not
 *    silently fall back to `chat()` or synthesize fake embeddings — either would
 *    corrupt a downstream vector index without visible error.
 * 4. **Defensive internal-consistency check**: if `capabilities().embeddings === true`
 *    but `driver.embed` is `undefined` (a driver author's bug), throw a distinct,
 *    clearly-worded error (e.g. `` `driver "${driver.id}" declares embeddings
 *    capability but does not implement embed()` ``) rather than letting a raw
 *    `TypeError: driver.embed is not a function` leak out.
 * 5. **Normalize `input`**: if `req.input` is a bare `string`, wrap it as a
 *    single-element `string[]` before calling `driver.embed()` (the driver-level
 *    interface always takes `string[]`, per § 10.1). If `req.input` is already a
 *    `string[]`, pass it through unchanged, preserving order.
 * 6. **Delegate**: call `driver.embed({ model: modelId, input: normalizedInput, signal: req.signal })`
 *    and await its result.
 * 7. **Return shape — the single-string-input convention**: the return shape is
 *    **always** `number[][]`, with exactly one entry when `input` was a single string,
 *    so callers never need to branch on whether they passed a string or an array.
 *    `embeddings[0]` is always "the vector for the first (or only) input."
 * 8. **Usage**: pass through whatever `usage` the driver's `embed()` call returned
 *    verbatim (it is optional per § 6/§ 10.1 — do not synthesize a fallback).
