// Driver registry — the kernel-side store of model-provider drivers
// (ARCHITECTURE.md § 10.1). Drivers (WebLLM, Ollama, or any future provider)
// plug into this registry; `bh.listModels()` aggregates their model
// catalogues into one merged list.
//
// Scope of THIS file (TASK_0009): the `DriverRegistry` class backing
// `bh.addDriver`/`bh.listModels`, plus the `driver.registered` framework event
// (§ 8.1). It does NOT implement any concrete driver (those are TASK_0019/
// 0020's job), does NOT resolve `modelSource` plugin hooks (TASK_0015), and
// does NOT route MCP sampling (TASK_0014).
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): web-standard APIs only. This file touches nothing
// outside of plain TypeScript — no `fetch`, no `crypto`, no Node built-ins. It
// is runtime-agnostic.
//
// PATH NOTE: TASK_0009 specifies `bhai/src/kernel/drivers.ts`, but the package
// layout already established by TASK_0002/TASK_0003 places the kernel under
// `src/core/` (see `src/core/index.ts` and the `./core` subpath export in
// `package.json`). This file follows the existing repo convention to keep one
// kernel directory; the behavioral contract is unchanged.

	 * SHADOWING CONVENTION (cross-referenced to TASK_0008): the architecture
	 * doc does not explicitly state what happens when `addDriver()` is called
	 * twice with the same `id`. This registry adopts the IDENTICAL convention
	 * TASK_0008 established for tool-name shadowing: later registration

	 * of BHAI's registries (tools, drivers, and — see TASK_0010 — commands).
	 * Rationale: same as TASK_0008's — conceptually the host still sees "a
	 * driver named X" continuously across the shadowing; nothing was removed,
	 * only updated.
	 *
	 * ASYMMETRY NOTE (deliberate, not an oversight): unlike TASK_0008's tool
	 * registry, there is no `driver.removed` event fired here — not even on
	 * explicit removal (which this registry does not expose at all in
	 * TASK_0009's scope). § 8.1 defines NO `driver.removed` row, so this
	 * registry must NOT invent one. Shadowing a driver only fires
	 * `driver.registered` for the new instance, with no corresponding
	 * "removed" signal for the old one. This is intentional: the spec defines
	 * no event to fire even if we wanted to draw the parallel with
	 * `tool.removed`.

	/**
	 * Merged model catalogue from every currently-registered driver (§ 6, § 10.1).
	 *
	 * Calls `driver.listModels()` on every registered driver in parallel
	 * (`Promise.all`) and concatenates the results into one flat `ModelInfo[]`,
	 * in registration order (the order drivers were inserted into the internal
	 * `Map`, which preserves insertion order for new keys and updates-in-place
	 * for shadowed keys — so a shadowed driver keeps its original position in
	 * the merge). The spec does not mandate an order; registration order is
	 * chosen as the deterministic, observable, host-predictable option.
	 *
	 * PARTIAL-FAILURE ASSUMPTION (the spec does not specify): if any one
	 * driver's `listModels()` rejects, the whole `listModels()` promise
	 * rejects too — rather than silently swallowing one driver's failure.
	 * Silently dropping a driver's models could surprise a host expecting a
	 * complete catalogue. A future task may revisit this with per-driver error
	 * isolation if that proves too brittle in practice, but do not implement
	 * partial-failure isolation speculatively here.
	 *
	 * NO DE-DUPLICATION: entries are NOT deduplicated across drivers by
	 * name/id/ref — different drivers may legitimately expose models with
	 * overlapping identifiers (e.g. two Ollama endpoints), and de-duplication
	 * policy is not specified anywhere in the doc; entries are left as-is.

	 * TODO(TASK_0015): merge in modelSource plugin-hook results here as well.
	 * Per ARCHITECTURE.md § 6 line 189, `listModels()` is documented as
	 * "merged: drivers + modelSource hooks" — this task (TASK_0009) only
	 * implements the driver half of that merge. TASK_0015 extends this method
