// Transport retry policy & request lifecycle events (ARCHITECTURE.md § 10.1,
// § 8.1, § 8.5). This module sits between the agent loop (TASK_0025+) and any
// `BHAIDriver.chat()` call, retrying only transient transport failures and
// emitting the `request` lifecycle event (`before` → `retry`* → `after`) so
// hosts can observe and patch outgoing driver calls.
//
// Scope of THIS file (TASK_0018): the `RetryPolicy` type, a
// `DEFAULT_RETRY_POLICY` constant, an explicit `isRetriableError(error)`
// classifier, and the `callDriverWithRetry(driver, request, policy, dispatch)`
// wrapper. It does NOT implement any driver (TASK_0019/0020), the agent loop
// (TASK_0025+), or the event bus itself (TASK_0004) — only the retry wrapper
// and its classifier.
//
// THE DISPATCH vs EMIT DISTINCTION (explicit assumption, § 8.4):
// This module fires the reserved `request` event via the bus's internal
// `dispatch` path, not the public, guarded `emit()`, per § 8.4's note that
// kernel lifecycle emissions are not a privileged side channel — same
// semantics, different entry point that skips the plugin-facing reserved-name
// check. `request` is in the § 8.1 reserved-namespace list, so a plugin
// calling the public `emit()` with the name `request` must throw; this
// kernel-internal wrapper uses `dispatch()` (the same internal bypass
// `EventBus` exposes for kernel-originated events) to fire it.
//
// ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY (§ 5): web-standard APIs only. This file touches only
// `AbortSignal`, async iterables, and `setTimeout` (via a swappable delay
// function for testability). No Node built-ins, no DOM, no imports from
// `src/plugins/**`.
//
// PATH NOTE: TASK_0018 specifies `bhai/src/kernel/retry.ts`, but the package
// layout already established by TASK_0002/TASK_0003 places the kernel under
// `src/core/` (see `src/core/index.ts` and the `./core` subpath export in
// `package.json`). This file follows the existing repo convention; the
// behavioral contract is unchanged.

/**
 * Classify whether an error is a transient transport/rate-limit failure that
 * the retry wrapper should retry (§ 10.1: "retrying only transient
 * transport/rate-limit errors").
 *
 * The architecture doc says only "retrying only transient transport/rate-limit
 * errors" without enumerating what counts as transient. This classifier
 * defines the exact, explicit classification:
 *
 * **Retriable (transient)**:
 * 1. A thrown error that is a network-level failure — i.e. a `TypeError`
 *    thrown by `fetch` itself (covers connection refused, DNS failure, and
 *    similar "failed to fetch" conditions in both browser and Node `fetch`
 *    implementations), OR an error object exposing a recognizable
 *    `cause`/`name` indicating a network fault (`error.name === 'TypeError'`
 *    or `error.name === 'NetworkError'`).
 * 2. An error carrying an HTTP `status` (or `response.status`) of `429`
 *    (rate limited), `502` (bad gateway), `503` (service unavailable), or
 *    `504` (gateway timeout). The expected error shape is
 *    `{ status?: number; retriable?: boolean }` (a loosely-typed `unknown`
 *    narrowed via a type guard) since drivers throw whatever shape is natural
 *    for their own transport, and this wrapper cannot assume a single error
 *    class hierarchy across driver plugins.
 * 3. A `DriverEvent` of `{ type: 'done', stopReason: 'error', error }` where
 *    the driver has explicitly signaled retriability by attaching
 *    `retriable: true` somewhere reachable on the event or its nested
 *    `error`. The exact narrow shape checked is
 *    `event.type === 'done' && event.stopReason === 'error' &&
 *     (event as { retriable?: boolean }).retriable === true`. This is the
 *    mechanism by which a driver that already knows "this specific failure
 *    is safe to retry" (e.g. it caught a 503 internally rather than letting
 *    `chat()` throw) can still request a kernel-level retry without the
 *    kernel having to parse driver-specific error shapes.
 *
 * **Non-retriable (do not retry)**:
 * - Any HTTP status in the `4xx` range other than `429` (e.g. `400` Bad
 *   Request, `401` Unauthorized, `403` Forbidden, `404` Not Found) — these
 *   indicate a malformed request or an auth/permission problem that a retry
 *   cannot fix.
 * - An `AbortError` (the request was cancelled via `AbortSignal` — retrying
 *   a deliberate cancellation would be actively wrong).
 * - Any error that does not match one of the three retriable patterns above
 *   — the default is **not retriable**, since silently retrying unclassified
 *   errors risks masking real bugs (e.g. a programming error inside a
 *   driver) behind repeated retries.
 *
 * Exported as a named function so it is unit-testable in isolation, not
 * buried as inline logic inside the retry loop.
 *
 * @param error The thrown error or yielded `done` event to classify.
 * @returns `true` if the failure is transient and should be retried.

/**
 * Wrap a `BHAIDriver.chat()` call with transport retry policy and `request`
 * lifecycle events (§ 10.1, § 8.5 step 8.2).
 *
 * Behavior:
 * 1. Before the first attempt, dispatch `request` with `state: 'before'` and
 *    payload `{ payload: request }`. Await the result; if any handler in the
 *    chain returned a patch (e.g. `{ payload: partialRequest }`), shallow-
 *    merge it onto `request` per § 8.2's patch-chaining rule, and use the
 *    patched request for the actual `driver.chat()` call. If a handler
 *    returns `{ block: true }`, treat it like any other blockable kernel
 *    event: stop before calling the driver at all and surface a rejection to
 *    the caller (consistent with § 8.2's general blocking contract, since
 *    § 8.1's `request` row does not explicitly mention blocking — this
 *    extends it uniformly with the rest of the event model rather than
 *    special-casing `request` as non-blockable).
 * 2. Call `driver.chat(patchedRequest)` and iterate its
 *    `AsyncIterable<DriverEvent>`, re-yielding every event to the caller as
 *    it arrives (this wrapper is a transparent pass-through on the happy
 *    path — callers cannot tell they're going through a wrapper unless a
 *    retry occurs).
 * 3. If iterating the driver's async iterable throws, or if a yielded event
 *    is `{ type: 'done', stopReason: 'error', ... }` that also satisfies the
 *    retriable classification:
 *    - If `isRetriableError` returns `false`, or the number of attempts
 *      already made equals `policy.maxRetries`, stop retrying: dispatch
 *      `request` with `state: 'after'` (payload `{ status: 'error', headers:
 *      undefined }`) and propagate the failure to the caller (re-throw the
 *      original error, or yield the terminal `done` event with
 *      `stopReason: 'error'` and stop iterating — preserving throw-vs-yield
 *      fidelity rather than converting one into the other).
 *    - Otherwise: dispatch `request` with `state: 'retry'` and payload
 *      `{ payload: patchedRequest, attempt: <1-based retry number> }`, wait
 *      according to `policy.backoff`, increment the attempt counter, and go
 *      back to step 2 (restart `driver.chat()` from scratch with the same
 *      patched request — do NOT re-run `request(before)` handlers on a
 *      retry, since `before` semantically means "before the first attempt").
 * 4. On eventual success (the iterable completes without throwing and its
 *    terminal `done` event has a `stopReason` other than `error`, or is
 *    absent because the driver simply stopped yielding), dispatch `request`
 *    with `state: 'after'` and payload `{ status: 'ok', headers: undefined }`.
 *
 * EDGE CASE — partial output before a retry: events already yielded have
 * reached the caller (e.g. partially rendered in a chat UI) before the retry
 * restarts the whole call from scratch. This wrapper does not attempt to
 * "un-yield" or deduplicate partial output — that is an agent-loop/UI concern
 * for a different task. This wrapper's job stops at faithfully replaying the
 * retry-and-restart mechanics and firing the right events.
 *
 * EDGE CASE — `AbortSignal` during a retry wait: if `request.signal` fires
 * while the wrapper is waiting on backoff, the delay rejects with an
 * `AbortError`-shaped error; the wrapper surfaces a terminal `done` event
 * with `stopReason: 'abort'`, fires `request(after)` with an error outcome,
 * and propagates an abort (no further retry after an explicit abort,
 * regardless of remaining `maxRetries`).
 *
 * @param driver The driver whose `chat()` is being wrapped.
 * @param request The original chat request.
 * @param policy Retry policy; defaults to {@link DEFAULT_RETRY_POLICY}.
 * @param dispatch The bus's internal `dispatch` primitive used to fire the
 *   reserved `request` event (see the file-header note on the dispatch vs
 *   emit distinction).
 * @param delay Optional override of the delay function (for tests).
