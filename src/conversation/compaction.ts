/**

 * All three triggers (manual `conversation.compact()`, auto-compaction check,
 * and `conversation.emit('compact', ...)` interception) converge on this single
 * implementation. It is the ONLY place in the codebase that inserts a summary
 * message and marks messages `contextIncluded: false`.
 *
 * @param conversation The conversation to compact.
 * @param source Which trigger initiated this pipeline: 'manual', 'auto', or 'emit'.
 * @param options Options passed by the trigger (only used for manual/emit; auto passes undefined).
 * @param completeFn Injected summary function (defaults to a stub; tests override with a mock).
 *
 * Behavior:
 * 1. Compute default fold point: keep the most recent DEFAULT_KEEP_COUNT messages unfolded.
 * 2. Fire `compact(before)` with mutable payload — handlers can return patches to:
 *    - Replace the prompt: `{ prompt: string }`
 *    - Append to the prompt: `{ appendPrompt: string }` or `{ prependPrompt: string }`
 *    - Pre-supply the summary: `{ summary: string, keepFrom: number }`
 *    - Block the entire pipeline: `{ block: true }` (no state change, no summary inserted)
 * 3. If blocked, return immediately.
 * 4. If no pre-supplied summary, set status='compacting', call completeFn, fire `compact(compacting)`.
 * 5. Insert a new `role: 'system'` message at the fold point with the summary text.
 * 6. Mark all messages before the fold point with `contextIncluded: false`.
 * 7. Revert status to its pre-compaction value, fire `compact(complete)`.
 *
 * The never-delete-history invariant: every pre-compaction message remains in the array,
 * only marked with `contextIncluded: false`. Message count increases by exactly 1.
