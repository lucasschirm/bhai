// Root superset barrel: re-exports the core kernel and every plugin.
// Consumers who want a minimal surface should import from '@lucasschirm/bhai/core'
// or a specific '@lucasschirm/bhai/plugins/*' entry instead.
// Tree-shaking (`sideEffects: false`) drops any re-exports a consumer does not use,
// so importing only `{ Bhai }` from root does not pull plugin code into the bundle.
//
// Adding a new plugin means appending one `export * from './plugins/<name>/index.js';`
// line here, plus the matching `package.json` exports entry and `tsup.config.ts` entry.

// `conversation/event-bus.ts` also names its class `EventBus`, which collides
// with the framework bus re-exported from `./core` above. The core bus owns the
// unqualified name (it is the kernel-wide dispatch mechanism of ARCHITECTURE.md
// § 8); the conversation bus — a narrower emit/fold primitive backing the
// system-prompt fold — is re-exported under an explicit alias.
