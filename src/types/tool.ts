// these types are missing from the TASK_0002 barrel when this task starts,
// add minimal local type stubs and flag the gap back to TASK_0002's owner
// rather than silently duplicating the type definitions"), TASK_0008 adds
// them here — in the canonical types home, not as duplicated stubs — and
// flags the gap so TASK_0002's owner can reconcile. The shapes match
// ARCHITECTURE.md § 9.1 verbatim; TASK_0002 may move/refine them but must
// preserve these field names and optionality for MCP wire-compatibility
// (§ 9.1: a BHAI tool definition *is* an MCP `Tool` object plus a local
// `execute` binding).
