// `embed`) as TASK_0009's responsibility and supplied only the shapes that
// cross the kernel/driver boundary (`GenerationParams`, `DriverEvent`,
// `ChatRequest`, `ToolWireDefinition`). TASK_0009 adds `BHAIDriver` here — in
// the canonical types home, alongside the other driver types — per TASK_0009's
// "if TASK_0002 has not yet declared `BHAIDriver`, this task must add it there
// ... and explicitly flag in a code comment that it did so on TASK_0002's
// behalf" instruction. The shape matches ARCHITECTURE.md § 10.1 lines 753-767
// verbatim, including `embed?` being optional.
