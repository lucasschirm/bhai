/**
 * The open extension point of the message contract.
 *
 * Plugins declare a field at runtime with `bh.defineMessageField(name)` — which
 * installs a non-enumerable accessor over `message.meta` — and declare its type
 * here by module augmentation, so `message.myField` typechecks without a cast:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare module "@lucasschirm/bhai" {
 *   interface BHAIMessageExtensions {
 *     sentiment?: "positive" | "negative"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Augmenting the package specifier works even though `dist/index.d.ts` only
 * re-exports this interface from a bundled chunk: TypeScript resolves the
 * augmented name through the barrel's re-export alias and merges into the
 * original declaration.
 *
 * In-repo code cannot use that specifier, because `@lucasschirm/bhai` only
 * resolves once `dist/` has been built — so the repository's own tests augment
 * the declaring module (`"./message.js"`) directly instead.
 *
 * Every member must be optional: a message carries a field only once the owning
 * plugin has registered it, and messages restored from a snapshot written before
 * the plugin existed will have nothing behind the accessor.
