# WebLLM Chat Example

A Lit 3 + TypeScript browser example demonstrating BHAI's core capabilities:
streaming responses, in-browser model execution via WebLLM, live telemetry
(decode/prefill tokens per second, time-to-first-token, context usage), and
client-side parsing of reasoning blocks.

## What it is

**bhai · local** is a single-page chat application that runs a curated set of small language models directly in your browser using WebGPU. It demonstrates:

1. **Streaming responses** — Text arrives incrementally as the model generates tokens.
2. **Live decode/prefill telemetry** — Real-time measurement of tokens-per-second during prefill (KV cache population) and decode (token generation), displayed as an instrument panel.
3. **Time-to-first-token (TTFT)** — Latency from message send to first token received.
4. **Reasoning blocks** — `<think>...</think>` regions split out by the framework (`parseThink: true`) and shown in a collapsible "Thought" panel.
5. **Model selection & cold-start feedback** — Download progress as weights are loaded from the cloud.
6. **Context usage** — Visual bar showing how much of the available context window is being used.
7. **Thermal design** — Visual metaphor where the app is cold/dim when idle, warming up as the model loads and runs (status dot, decode gauge, and download progress bar all interpolate from cold cyan → warm coral).

## Running it

### Prerequisites

- A WebGPU-capable browser: **Chrome 113+** or **Edge 113+** (Safari and Firefox do not yet support WebGPU).
- An internet connection (to download model weights the first time).
- ~2–3 GB of free disk space in your browser's cache (depending on model size; smaller models ~500 MB, larger ~2 GB).

### Quick start

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run preview   # Builds @lucasschirm/bhai, then starts the example server
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever Vite reports). The model selector should populate; pick a model and send a message.

### Iterative development

If you're modifying the example code:

```bash
# Terminal 1: watch and build the package
pnpm run build        # One-time build
pnpm test:watch       # Or watch for lib changes

# Terminal 2: run the dev server
pnpm --filter bhai-example dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## How it works

### Architecture

The example is TypeScript, with one module per responsibility: `app/` owns kernel
and engine calls but never touches the DOM, `components/` owns the DOM but knows
nothing about BHAI, and `main.ts` is the only file that knows the `index.html`
element ids.

```
main.ts (bootstrap)
├─ Side-effect imports every component module (registers custom elements)
├─ Resolves every element by id
└─ Hands them to the two orchestrators

app/ (orchestration — no DOM)
├─ webllm-engine.ts — WebGPU guard, model allowlist, MLCEngine creation
├─ chat-controller.ts — conversation lifecycle, send/abort, TTFT, stats pipeline
├─ mcp-controller.ts — McpManager subscription, add-server form, persistence
└─ fatal-error.ts — the one path spanning telemetry + composer

components/ (DOM — one Lit custom element per region)
├─ status-indicator.ts → <bhai-status-indicator>
├─ composer.ts → <bhai-composer>
├─ conversation-view.ts → <bhai-conversation> (user/assistant bubbles, streaming)
├─ cold-start-panel.ts → <bhai-cold-start>
├─ telemetry-panel.ts → <bhai-telemetry>
└─ mcp-server-list.ts, mcp-server-card.ts, mcp-tool-list.ts,
   mcp-add-form.ts, mcp-error-dialog.ts → <bhai-mcp-*>

lib/ (pure functions, testable)
├─ dom.ts — el(), byId(), iconButton()
├─ stats.ts — extract tok/s from engine.runtimeStatsText()
├─ thermal.ts — map decode tok/s to colors
├─ format.ts — pretty-print numbers for display
└─ mcp-store.ts — persist servers, parse headers, interpret errors
```

### Searchable MCP lists

The MCP panel's server list and each connected server's tool list have a filter
box and sort buttons. Filtering and sorting are implemented reactively inside
Lit, driven by `@state` properties, so the DOM always stays under Lit's
control. This avoids external DOM mutation that can conflict with Lit's virtual
DOM, while still preserving per-card state such as an expanded tool disclosure
across unrelated re-renders (`repeat(..., keyFn, ...)` keeps the same element
instances).

The components render every item node themselves, so MCP tool names, descriptions
and error messages are bound as escaped text by Lit. See
`example/AGENTS.md` for the full component contract.

The conversation stream is deliberately *not* a searchable list: it appends
streaming tokens incrementally, which would be incompatible with a filterable
list that re-renders on every keystroke.

### Thought splitting (`parseThink`)

WebLLM's driver only emits `kind: "text"` deltas (no structured reasoning channel), and reasoning models such as Qwen3 inline their thinking as `<think>...</think>` in the response text. The conversation is therefore created with `parseThink: true`:

```ts
conversation = await bh.createConversation({
  model: `webllm/${modelId}`,
  parseThink: true,
})
```

The framework then splits the stream as it arrives — statefully, so tags may straddle chunk boundaries — and the example only has to route each channel:

1. **`kind: "reasoning"`** → `turn.appendThought()`, a collapsible `<details>` region created on the first delta.
2. **`kind: "text"`** → `turn.appendAnswer()`, the main message body, which never contains `<think>` markup.

`turn` is the handle `conversationView.beginAssistantTurn()` returns; its methods close over that message's own nodes, so streaming never has to look the element back up.

The full reasoning text is also available on the finished message as `message.think` (backed by `meta.think`, so it survives a snapshot round-trip).

This example previously shipped its own `src/lib/think-stream.js` parser; that parser now lives in the framework at `src/conversation/think-stream.ts`.

### Stats & telemetry

After each turn completes, the example calls `engine.runtimeStatsText()` and parses it:

```javascript
const statsText = await engine.runtimeStatsText()
const { prefillTps, decodeTps } = parseRuntimeStats(statsText)
```

Results are displayed in real-time as the telemetry panel updates:

- **Decode tok/s**: Tokens generated per second (the bottom phase of inference). Shown with a thermal-colored gauge whose fill/color update live based on this measurement.
- **Prefill tok/s**: Tokens processed per second during KV cache population (the first phase).
- **TTFT**: Time-to-first-token, measured from when `sendMessage()` was called to when the first delta arrived.
- **Tokens**: Input and output token counts (from `conversation.usage`).
- **Context**: A visual bar showing context window usage (output tokens ÷ max context size). Hidden if the model's context window is unknown.

All numbers are formatted for readability (`formatTps`, `formatTokens`, etc.).

### Model selection

The model picker is a custom `<bhai-model-select>` wrapper around the
`<lit-typeahead>` element from `@lucasschirm/litjs-typeahead`. `main.ts` seeds
it from `bh.listModels()` and keeps it in sync via the `models.changed` event,
so the catalogue reacts to driver and `modelSource` changes without any direct
DOM manipulation. The WebLLM driver is constructed with the installed
`@mlc-ai/web-llm` package's `prebuiltAppConfig` so the catalogue is available
before the engine is fully warmed:

```typescript
const driver = new WebLLM({
  engine,
  appConfig: prebuiltAppConfig,
})
```

The default selection prefers a Qwen3 model because it emits reasoning blocks,
which the demo's Thought panel is built to surface; otherwise it falls back to
the first available model. Selecting a model creates a fresh conversation
(simplest correct behavior).

### Cold-start feedback

When the user sends their first message, `engine.reload()` is called lazily (by the WebLLM driver), triggering downloads of model weights. The example displays a download progress panel:

```ts
// app/webllm-engine.ts wraps this; main.ts supplies the callback.
const engine = createEngine((progress, text) => ui.coldStart.show(progress, text))
```

The progress bar fill and color interpolate from cold cyan → warm coral. Once download completes, the status dot turns green (ready).

### Abort/Stop

While generating, the Send button becomes a Stop button. Clicking Stop calls `conversation.abort()`, which propagates an abort signal through the agent loop and cancels the in-flight `sendMessage()` promise. The UI state is reset in a `finally` block.

### MCP servers

The telemetry rail carries an **MCP SERVERS** panel where you attach
streamable-HTTP MCP servers at runtime. Expand *Add HTTP server*, paste an
endpoint URL (optionally a name and extra headers, one `Key: Value` per line),
and press Connect.

Each server gets a card showing its live status — a pulsing violet dot while
the handshake is in flight, green once connected, coral on failure — plus a
collapsible list of the tools it exposes. Connected tools land in the same
shared registry as local ones, so the model can call them in conversation with
no further wiring.

Card actions:

| Icon | Shown when | Does |
| ---- | ---------- | ---- |
| ⟳ | connected | Re-polls `tools/list` and updates the tool list |
| 🐛 | failed | Opens the error-details dialog |
| ↻ | failed | Retries the connection |
| ✕ | always | Closes the session and unregisters the server's tools |

The 🐛 dialog shows the error name, endpoint, timestamp, full message, a stack
trace, and — where the raw message is unhelpful — a plain-language hint about
what to check.

Two constraints worth knowing:

- **CORS applies.** The endpoint must send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for
  `http://localhost:5173` and allow the `Content-Type`,
  `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Session-Id`, and `Authorization` headers.
- **Tool lists do not update on their own.** The client holds no SSE stream, so
  `notifications/tools/list_changed` never arrives — that is what ⟳ is for.

Servers persist to `localStorage` and reconnect on load. ⚠️ That includes any
headers you entered, stored in plaintext under this origin — convenient for a
local demo, not a pattern to copy into production.

## CSS variables

All colors, typefaces, and key spacing tokens live in `variables.css` and are
imported in `index.html` before `styles.css`. Every component template reuses the
same structural classes it always did (`.message`, `.telemetry-panel`,
`.mcp-server`, etc.), so the global stylesheet controls the look while the
custom elements control the structure and behavior.

## Design: "Cold start → running hot"

The visual design uses a **thermal metaphor**:

- **Cold** (cyan, `#38bdf8`) — No model loaded, idle state.
- **Warming** (animated shimmer cyan↔coral) — Model is downloading.
- **Ready** (green, `#34d399`) — Model loaded, ready to accept input.
- **Generating** (pulsing coral, `#fb7185`) — Model is running, decoding tokens.

The status dot reflects the current state. The decode tok/s gauge also uses this thermal ramp: slow decode stays cool, fast decode gets warm. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` for accessibility.

The layout is a two-column grid (desktop, ≥861px wide):
- **Left**: Conversation stream (chat bubbles).
- **Right**: Telemetry panel (fixed-height scrollable).

On mobile (<861px), it stacks into a single column.

## Troubleshooting

### "WebGPU unavailable — this demo needs a WebGPU-capable browser"

- **Cause**: You're using Safari, Firefox, or an older version of Chrome/Edge.
- **Solution**: Update to Chrome 113+ or Edge 113+. Enable WebGPU if needed (it's on by default in recent versions; if it's not, check `chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu`).

### "Model download failed — check your connection and try again"

- **Cause**: Network error during weight download, or `@mlc-ai/web-llm`'s CDN is unreachable.
- **Solution**:
  - Check your internet connection.
  - Try again (it may retry with exponential backoff).
  - If the issue persists, check the browser console for detailed error messages.
  - Verify you're using `@mlc-ai/web-llm ^0.2.70` or later.

### "No models loaded" or slow first token

- **Cause**: WebGPU initialization or model weight download is slow (common on first load or on slower hardware).
- **Solution**:
  - Wait — cold-start can take 20–60 seconds on first load (weights are ~500 MB–2 GB).
  - On subsequent runs, weights are cached in your browser, so it's much faster.
  - Check your GPU: WebGPU prefers discrete GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD). Integrated GPUs are slower.

### First token arrives slowly (high TTFT)

- **Cause**: KV cache population (prefill phase) takes time on the first token.
- **Solution**: Normal for the first token. Subsequent tokens should arrive faster (see the decode tok/s gauge). Try a smaller model (e.g., Qwen3-0.6B) for faster response.

### "Thought" panel never appears

- **Cause**: The model isn't generating `<think>...</think>` tags, or the conversation was not created with `parseThink: true`.
- **Solution**: 
  - Confirm the model supports reasoning (e.g., Qwen3 does; Phi does not).
  - Try a different prompt that encourages reasoning (e.g., "Think step by step about...").
  - Check the browser console for any parsing errors.

### Browser tab crashes or becomes unresponsive

- **Cause**: WebGPU or WASM exceeded memory limits (can happen with very large models on low-memory devices).
- **Solution**:
  - Reload and try a smaller model.
  - Close other tabs to free memory.
  - Check your device's available RAM (WebLLM needs ~2–3x the model size in working memory).

### An MCP server fails with "TypeError: Failed to fetch"

- **Cause**: Most often CORS. A browser reports a CORS rejection, an
  unreachable host, and a refused connection identically, with no detail
  available to JavaScript.
- **Solution**:
  - Confirm the server sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for
    `http://localhost:5173` and allows the `Content-Type`,
    `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Session-Id`, and `Authorization` headers
    (including on the `OPTIONS` preflight).
  - Confirm something is actually listening on that host and port.
  - Check the browser's Network tab, which shows the CORS reason even though
    JavaScript cannot.

### An MCP server fails with "MCP HTTP 404 Not Found"

- **Cause**: The URL points at the host but not at the MCP endpoint.
- **Solution**: Most servers mount it at `/mcp` — check the server's docs for
  the exact path.

### An MCP server connects but lists no tools

- **Cause**: The server exposes none, or it was attached with `deferred: true`
  (in which case only the two synthetic `list_tools`/`search_tools` entries
  register until the model calls one).
- **Solution**: Press ⟳ to re-poll. Note that a re-poll is a no-op unless the
  server declared the `tools.listChanged` capability.

### A newly added tool doesn't show up

- **Cause**: Expected — the client holds no SSE stream, so it never receives
  `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
- **Solution**: Press ⟳ on the server's card.

## Development notes

### Lit 3 + TypeScript components

The example uses Lit 3 custom elements for its UI. Each component is a
`LitElement` subclass decorated with `@customElement`, `@property`, `@state`, and
`@query`. They are deliberately rendered in the **light DOM**
(`createRenderRoot() { return this }`) so the host page's global CSS variables and
selectors keep working. This is a deliberate trade-off — style encapsulation is
sacrificed for a simple migration path from the prior vanilla-JS components and
for the CSS-variable requirement.

### Never `innerHTML`

Every node in the example is built with Lit `html` bindings or `createElement` +
`textContent`. Lit escapes text bindings automatically, so MCP tool names, tool
descriptions, and error messages are safe by default. The security-critical
regression is guarded by
`example/src/components/mcp-server-card.test.ts`, which injects an
`<img src=x onerror=…>` payload.

### Workspace-linked package

The example imports `@lucasschirm/bhai` via the workspace (`workspace:*`
dependency in `package.json`), ensuring it uses the BUILT `dist/` output (run
`pnpm run build` first). It never imports from source (`../../src/*.ts`), which
exercises the published subpath exports.

### Testing

The `src/lib/` functions (stats parsing, formatting, MCP persistence) are pure
and testable in Node with no browser globals. The three components with real
logic — the server card, the server list, and the conversation view — are tested
against a DOM, with `// @vitest-environment happy-dom` at the top of each file so
the root `vitest.config.ts` stays `node` by default. All of it runs via `pnpm test`.

Because custom element updates are async, the DOM tests `await` the host's
`updateComplete` and, for the server list, the `updateComplete` of child
`<bhai-mcp-server-card>` elements as well.

`main.ts` and `app/*` are thin glue around BHAI APIs and the tested libs; they are
covered by the smoke run (`pnpm run preview`).

### Typechecking

`example/` is its own TypeScript project (`example/tsconfig.json`), because it
needs the DOM lib, `experimentalDecorators: true`, and `useDefineForClassFields:
false` for Lit, which the kernel deliberately does not, and because resolving
`@lucasschirm/bhai` through the workspace link requires `pnpm run build` to have
produced `dist/` first. The root `pnpm typecheck` runs both projects.

### Build output

Vite bundles `src/main.ts` and everything it imports into a single JavaScript
file that references the workspace-linked `@lucasschirm/bhai` by its published
subpath names (`@lucasschirm/bhai/plugins/webllm`, etc.). The `dist/index.html`
is served as-is.
